# 🚀 Quick Start: `docker build -t autotest . && docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/reports:/app/reports autotest`

# 🎯 Professional E2E Testing Framework for Sauce Demo

**Enterprise-grade browser automation framework built with Python, Playwright, and pytest. Features advanced BDD architecture, visual regression testing, and Docker-first deployment.**

## 🔥 Key Features That Set This Framework Apart

### 🧠 **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Architecture**
- Human-readable test scenarios using pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.smoke`, `@pytest.mark.full_run`)
- Business-oriented test organization with clear separation of smoke and regression suites
- Descriptive test naming that reflects actual user behavior and business requirements
- Page Object Model (POM) implementation for maintainable and scalable test structure

### 🎭 Multi-User Testing Capability
- 5 different user types testing: standard, locked_out, problem, performance_glitch, error, and visual users
- Comprehensive user journey coverage from authentication to checkout completion
- Edge case scenarios including error handling and performance bottlenecks

### 📸 Advanced Visual Testing & Reporting
- Automatic screenshot capture for failed tests with embedded HTML reports
- Visual regression testing with image comparison algorithms
- Pixel-perfect UI validation using PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Self-contained HTML reports with no external dependencies

### ⚡️ Performance & Scalability
- Lightning-fast smoke tests (30 seconds) for rapid feedback
- Comprehensive regression suite (7 minutes) for thorough validation
- Configurable execution modes (headless/headed, slow-mo, timeouts)
- Resource-optimized Docker containers with minimal footprint

### 🔧 Production-Ready Configuration
- Environment-specific settings via config.json
- Flexible browser configuration (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit support)
- Custom resolution and timeout settings
- Structured logging with configurable levels

### 🐳 Docker-First Approach
- Zero-setup execution - just Docker required
- Consistent environment across all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Automatic dependency management and browser installation
- Volume mounting for seamless report and log access
